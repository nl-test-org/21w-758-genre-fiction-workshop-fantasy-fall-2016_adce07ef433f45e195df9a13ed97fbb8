Fantasy
-------

Syllabus - heavy reading

Your magic wand

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Arthur C. Clarke

Your wand = smart phone

Your spells = apps (not games), maps, Uber, ordering food, buying stuff (Amazon, ebay, etc.), instant delivery, weather prediction

Why Fantasy? Why is it so popular?

17th century Age of Reason

*   Split in the way we looked at the world

Renaissance - holistic learning

*   All disciplines integrated

Age of Reason - split

*   Split disciplines
*   AND made those that did not work with "logic" & "reason" no longer legitimate

Unfortunately this split mirrors parts of the mind - conscious, subconscious, unconscious

So the subconscious/unconscious parts of the mind were given short shift and we are more alienated from ourselves and our needs

Mythology & Mythos
------------------

Every culture has a mythos

Every culture/language group as an original myth

Foundation myth that at bottom gets into the basic ideas of Archetypes - Gods, Kings, Rulership

For the English speaking world, that mythos is Arthur
