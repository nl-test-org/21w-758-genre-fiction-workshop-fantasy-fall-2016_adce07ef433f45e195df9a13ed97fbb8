Myth & Sandman (Carl Jung)
--------------------------

What is Myth? vs. Legend?

Myth - article "stories of the gods"

Myth resonates in the realm of sacred where there is meaning

Campbell & Myth - 4 functions

1.  Mystical - put us in touch with the wonder - what a wonder the universe is, what we are, and to experience awe before this wonder
2.  Cosmology - an image of this universe - what it is made of, what it looks like, who inhabits it!
3.  Sociological - tells people how to behave and to support a certain social order
4.  Psychological - how to live a human life (a good life) under any circumstances

Myth as metaphor/myth IS metaphor

Dream/myth/gods

We dream/create gods

Gaimen - the business of fantasy is to make metaphors concrete

Jung and the Collective Unconscious
-----------------------------------

*   How do you feel about it?
    
*   Accept? Reject?
    

(Fear of snakes & big cats - biological - our predators, even among urban people)

_Jungian Archetypes_

Let's discuss then get into a few that are relevant to Fantasy

*   The King
*   The Shadow - personal - what we present in social roles
*   Anima/Animus - self-combination, fully integrated
*   Father - stern, powerful, authority
*   Mother - nurturing, comfort
*   Child - longing for innocence, rebirth, salvation
*   Wise Old man - guidance, knowledge, wisdom
*   Hero - champion, defender, rescuer
*   Maiden - innocence, desire, purity
*   Trickster - deceiver, liar, troublemaker

Tolkien - myth Eddas

Tolkien as a Beowulf scholar

Doll's House
------------

*   Prologue as myth
    
*   Nada and Dream (as Kai'ckl)
    
*   Nada knows she cannot marry the Endless even if they love each other. She is mortal, he is NOT, he is other
